We propose a novel distributional flow matching framework (scDFM) for robust single-cell perturbation prediction, which models the full distribution of perturbed cellular expression profiles conditioned on control states, thereby overcoming limitations of existing methods that rely on cell-level correspondences and fail to capture population-level transcriptional shifts.
